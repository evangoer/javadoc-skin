# Sample Javadoc for Developing Against

This directory contains Java source code and generated
Javadoc files, used as a represenative Javadoc project for
developing javadoc-skin. The original source code is a
snapshot taken from the Apache Zookeeper project, which is
a decent size and has reasonably complete Javadoc comments. 
However, the Zookeeper source snapshot & built HTML is 
included in this repo only as a convenience, and is not an 
integral part of the javadoc-skin project.
